Sample problem featuring the factory pattern.

# Class problem
Welcome to Pizza<sup>2</sup>! Our kitchen already outputs messages when a new Pizza or Calzone is ordered. See for yourself by running the following command:

```
python3 main.py -t P
```

```
python3 main.py -t C
```

Our chef wants to add a new item to the menu... Stromboli!! Using the factory design pattern, add the Stromboli dish to the menu by outputting messages when a Stromboli is ordered!
